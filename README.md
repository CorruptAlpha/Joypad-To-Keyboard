# Joypad-To-Keyboard

Hobby project

Software to use gamepad as keyboard and mouse. It's created for old games which not support pad steering.

How to configure it:

For all buttons and triggers of controller it's possible to assign any button of keyboard or mouse.
There are three options to execute keyboard button:
- Press
- Hold
- Realease on second click (it's useful in some cases when you have to hold f.e. alt to see items)

Cross and sticks you can use to move mouse cursor or as buttons:
Moving mouse has to modes:
- Mouse Move (classic mouse move)
- Mouse Circle Move (cursor is moving around circle, useful for running in games)
to mouse moving you can add button actions.
